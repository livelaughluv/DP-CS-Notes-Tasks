For each, what are some of the effects (pros & cons) of some of these advancements of IT?
    
1. The Advancement of Chess engines:
         - Allows a higher level of learning 
         - Allows people to cheat in chess
         - Allows children to begin learning chess young
         - Allows people to gain a certain understadning on chess theory
         - Allows a lot of cheating
         - A lot of cheating
2. Photomath
         - Allows kids to expand their math skills
         - Allows for a monopoly and requiring pay
         - Allows for cheating
         - Kids will become reliant""")

reliability: refers to the operation of hardware, the design of software, the accuracy of data or the correspondence of data with the real world. Data may be unreliable if it has been entered incorrectly or if it becomes outdated. The reliability of machines, software and data determines our confidence in their value.
integrity: refers to safeguarding the accuracy and completeness of stored data. Data lacks integrity when it has been changed accidentally or tampered with. Examples of data losing integrity are where information is duplicated in a relational database and only one copy is updated or where data entries have been maliciously altered.
inconsistency: refers to the protection of hardware, software, machines and networks from unauthorized access. Security measures include restricted access to machines and networks for certain employees or to prevent access by hackers. The degree of security of information systems largely determines society’s confidence in the information contained in the systems.

The degree of security of information systems largely determines society’s confidence in the information contained in the systems.
privacy and anonymity: Privacy is the ability of individuals and groups to determine for themselves when, how and to what extent information about themselves is shared with others. At its extreme, privacy becomes anonymity when, for instance, a person uses it to conceal his or her true identity in order to cyber-bully someone else. Conversely, excessive privacy could also conceal the perpetrators of criminal, terrorist or computer hacking acts from law enforcement agencies.
I.P.:includes ideas, discoveries, writings, works of art, software, collections and presentations of data. Copyright, trademarks and patents exist to protect intellectual property. However, the easy and accurate duplication methods made available through IT can undermine such protection.
Digital Divide / Equality of Access: The growth of the use of IT systems has led to disparities in the use of, and access to, information technologies. Disparities exist not only internationally between countries, but also within countries between different socio-economic groups as well as within what may appear to be relatively homogenous groups. This may lead to groups or individuals without access to IT being disadvantaged. For example, while telelearning may bring previously unavailable opportunities to everyone’s doorstep, factors such as the cost and availability of hardware, software or access to the internet may create a “digital divide”.
surveillance: Policies often include some form, even if limited, of surveillance. This may be to protect the general population, or if at a place of business or school, may be to help protect and keep the network stable, or to ensure that the technology is being used appropriately. Watch this video from LinkedIn Learning for a bit more discussion on policy related to surveillance.
globalization & cultural diversity:
means the diminishing importance of geographical, political, economic and cultural boundaries. IT has played a major role in reducing these boundaries. For example, any dramatic event anywhere in the world can be broadcast almost instantly by television or on the internet. However, the new “global village” may lead to the extinction of minority languages.
I.T. Policies: This video from LinkedIn Learning will give you more insight into the different levels and documents and current practices in Policy in industry.
standards & protocols: Policies often include some form, even if limited, of surveillance. This may be to protect the general population, or if at a place of business or school, may be to help protect and keep the network stable, or to ensure that the technology is being used appropriately. Watch this video from LinkedIn Learning for a bit more discussion on policy related to surveillance.
people & machines: The use of IT systems brings significant advantages, for instance in ease of use, being available 24/7, or through its use rather than exposing humans to a potentially hazardous environment. However, this can raise concerns about the rate at which technology is being introduced and issues that may arise from insufficient testing in critical situations such as air traffic control. The ultimate fear of many people is that future systems will be programmed to make decisions that would be better taken by humans, such as the decision to deploy nuclear weapons.
There are also social impacts such as internet addiction, where people feel that they can never get away from IT and are trapped on a “digital treadmill”.
Digital Citizenship:can be defined as appropriate behaviour that represents the responsible, ethical and legal approach that individuals take in any situation with respect to the use of IT. Digital citizenship permeates, in one way or another, all of the preceding social and ethical considerations.

    print("""Add the following terms and definitions to your notes.
Constant Exposure to Communication Technology: Citizens better informed about the world, their community, friends, and family. However, there can be psychological impacts including stress, poor concentration, and short attention span. Additionally, this may also create additional obstacles to personal 1-to-1 relationships. 
The Internet: Access to nearly immediate access to new tools, new ways to obtain information, new ways to share information. However, this can result in internet addiction, neglecting real life, and social media obsession.
Gaming: Interactive medium capable of telling stories and providing intellectual stimulation. Also can improve hand-eye coordination. Users may have lower levels of concentration, sleep deprivation, social desensitization, addiction, and neglect real life and educational / personal development.
Developments of Smartphones: Wide variety of uses is cheaper than the cost of buying devices that handle all the uses individually; gps, computer, internet, gaming platform, movies, camera, phone, etc. Smartphones have a continual increasing cost of the hardware, and the frequency at which they are replaced results in lots of e-waste.
Over use of Mobile Devices: Easier communication with family. Easier communication in emergencies. However, can be an obstacle to in-person communication. Additionally, there may be possible health consequences, issues with addiction, and increased accidents due to a lack of awareness while in-use (car accidents for example).
